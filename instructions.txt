In order to see the problem you're facing, go ahead and attempt a merge
by running `git merge good-to-merge`. You will notice that git does not
let you proceed because of uncommitted changes to index.txt.

In order to save your changes to index.txt without losing them and without
committing them, go ahead and run the `git stash` command. Once the changes
have been stashed, you should be able to see your stashed changes using
`git stash show`.

Now that the changes are out of the way, go ahead and re-run `git merge good-to-merge`
to complete the merge. We can re-apply our changes on top of the merged
branch by now running `git stash pop`. Once you pop the changes from your
stash, you will notice `git status` shows the change has been re-applied
to the working index, and `git stash show` shows that no changes are any
longer stashed.
